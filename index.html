          <p>
            Thanks for visiting my portfolio! My name is Charles Hargrave, and I
            am a student enrolled in the University of Denverâ€™s full-stack web
            development program. Although I am new to web development, I am
            excited and motivated to learn and hone my skills in order to make
            this a new career path for myself. <br /><br />

            I was first exposed to coding while working towards my Bachelors of
            Science in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Iowa, using
            technologies like C, C++, MatLab, and Mathematica. Upon graduating,
            instead of applying these skill sets, I began a career in sales at a
            leading medical device company. After living in San Francisco and
            being exposed to the tech industry, I knew it was an industry that I
            wanted to be in and transitioned my career to tech sales, working
            for a website nearly all developers are familiar with - Stack
            Overflow. Since then, I have endlessly contemplated transitioning my
            career into web development, so in the summer of 2022, I finally
            took the leap! <br /><br />

            I look forward to adding to this portfolio and building web
            applications that can make a positive impact on the world. Please
            feel free to connect with me - my contact information is below and I
            am always open to making new connections within the industry.
            <br /><br />
            :)
